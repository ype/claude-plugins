# Prompt Quality Analysis

Please analyze the prompt quality for my next message. Before I submit my prompt, I want to know:

1. **Token Efficiency**: Is my context appropriately sized?
2. **Example Quality**: Do I have sufficient code examples?
3. **Clarity**: Are my requirements specific enough?
4. **Relevance**: Is the context I'm providing relevant to the task?

Use the MCP tool `prompt_advisor_analyze` to evaluate these factors.

Provide your analysis in this format:

## Quality Score: [X/10]

### Strengths
- [What's good about this prompt]

### Improvements
- [Specific suggestions with examples]

### Recommendations
- [Actionable next steps]

If the score is <7, suggest specific improvements before I proceed.
